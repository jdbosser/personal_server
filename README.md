# Get a nixos machine on digital ocean
Run [nixos-infect][1]. It can be done with the following command as root on an ubuntu 16.04 machine:
```
    git clone https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect
    sudo ./nixos-infect/nixos-infect
```
You will probably be kicked out from the server due to ssh not trusting it anymore. On your machine that has connected to digital ocean, run 
```
    ssh-keygen -R <host>
```
So for example 
```
    ssh-keygen -R 192.168.3.10
```
if your digital ocean server has the ip `192.168.3.10`. [Source][2].

# Getting this repo onto the machine 

You need git for this to work. Add git temporarly:
```
nix-shell -p git
```
and then you can
```
git clone https://github.com/jdbosser/personal_server.git
```
Now you need to add a link to the configuration file into `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`
```
rm /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
ln -s $(pwd)/personal_server/configuration.nix /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
```
and place the `hardware-configuration.nix` and `networking.nix` files in the personal server folder
```
mv /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix personal_server/
mv /etc/nixos/networking.nix personal_server/
```
and finally run 
```
nixos-rebuild switch
```
to get the server up and running. 

# Set up of domains
It is easy to link a domain if the domain has a digitial ocean nameserver. If that is the case, go to digital ocean panel for **Networking** and link domains. 

If the domain is not in digital ocean, add it. Then, in hover, where I have bought my domains, you add the name servers to the domains:
```
	ns1.digitalocean.com
	ns2.digitalocean.com
	ns3.digitalocean.com
```
Default in hover is `ns1.hover.com` and `ns2.hover.com`. For other domain registrars, look at [this resource][3]

# Documentation on how I went about setting up configuration.nix

## Setup nginx
In your `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` file, add the following:
```
  # Setup firewall
  networking.firewall.enable = true;
  networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 80 443 ];

  # Setup nginx
  services.nginx.enable = true;
```
which is pretty self explanatory to get nginx up and running. 

### Setup defualt virtualHost
Setting up a virtualHost to be accessed from the normal ip adress was a little bit more difficult than expected, but ended up with only a handful of files. First, I created a simple website in a folder `test_website/index.html` containing
```
    <h1> Hej och v√§lkommen! </h1>
```
which in English translates to "Hello and welcome!". Next, I made sure that nginx has access to the file. It seems lite nginx needs to have read access in the whole file tree. In my case, I located the test website in `/var/www/test_website`. Thus, giving all applications and groups read permission in `/root` will let nginx see the test website. **This is probably not a really good idea. Could be better to place the website in `/etc/www` like most people do**. 
```
    chmod -R 755 /root
```
Next, we declare a virtualHost in the `configuration.nix`-file:
```
  # Setup default virtualhost
  services.nginx.virtualHosts.<ip> = {
    root = "/var/www/test_website";
    default = true;
    listen = [ {addr = "<ip>"; port = 80;} ];
    locations= {
        "/" = {
                tryFiles = "$uri $uri/index.html";
        };
    };
  };
```
Which line by line is
1. A comment
2. Where the files for the test website are located
3. If someone visits the ip for the server, this is the website to display. **Do not know if this is needed when the virtualHost name is the ip.**
4. The server listens for requests on the ip adress on the default port. 
5. If someone visits the ip directly, make sure we return the index.html file. 

### Setup of https

Setting up https was pretty straight forward. I had a lot of trouble getting the subdomain `www` to work. In the end, i failed to get https work for both without setting up two servers. Anyway, I changed the virtualhost to this:
```
  services.nginx.virtualHosts."<domain>" = {
    root = "/var/www/test_website";
    default = true;
    forceSSL = true;
    enableACME = true;
    locations= {
    	"/" = {
		tryFiles = "$uri $uri/index.html";
	};
    };

```
which was the only way to do it it seems like. 

## Setup of minecraft

Minecraft-server is already among the nixos modules. 

However, there is one wierd thing that happens whenever the `minecraft-server.service` is running: it is no longer possible to rebuild the system since nixos cannot connect to the deamon. I am getting errors like:
```
cannot open connection to remote store 'daemon': writing to file: Broken pipe
```
when running `nixos-rebuild switch`.
To fix this, make sure that the `minecraft-server.service` is stopped before running `nixos-rebuild switch`
